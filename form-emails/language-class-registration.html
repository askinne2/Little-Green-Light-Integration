                <p>There are many benefits to learning a new language. When you study, you provide yourself with the opportunity to become more open-minded, to learn more about different cultures, and to be able to communicate with others in more than your native tongue. This is an invaluable skill and we are so happy you’ve chosen Upstate International.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions or concerns about your registration, please reach out to linley@upstateinternational.org.</p>
                <p>We can’t wait to see what you accomplish!</p>
